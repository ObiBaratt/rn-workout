## Intro
React-Native Mobile app for generating specific powerlifting workouts. A remake and mobile optimization of one of my first apps [Workout Web](https://github.com/ObiBaratt/Workout-Web). 
This version is much smoother, focuses on local storage as the data store instead of a centralized server that really served no purpose beyond learning. This local first development makes the   
app fast and smooth, no waiting for API calls or internet connectivity when all you really want to do is start your workout!

## Running the app
- Clone the repo
- ```npm install```
- Install Expo Go from the App / Play Store on a phone.
- ```npm start```
- Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app

## What I'm proud of
- The app works exactly how I want it to, its super fast, and gets me what I need when I need it.
- Setting up a solid project with tools designed to boost code quality: pre-commit hooks that lint, format, and type check the project ensuring bad code doesn't get pushed.
- Figuring out some of the table animations. Initially I just rendered the entire table, but that made it feel jarring, through user feedback and extensive testing I found the
perfect balance between not delaying the information, and smooth animations making the app feel great to use.

## Improvements
- I'd like to collaborate with a designer to make it look sleeker. This app is a tool to plan and track workouts, so my initial UI design was bare bones in order to make UX as smooth as possible.
That's fine for me - but users have said they'd prefer something with more polished looks.
- Allowing users to create their own workouts.
- Potentially allowing users to share their workouts.

## Following the "Gen Program" link leads to a selection, and then uses the program data + your local data to generate your workout.
